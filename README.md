# Quizlet-like Flashcard Generator with AI SDK  

This project is a **Quizlet-style** app built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and the **Vercel AI SDK**, where users upload PDFs, and AI generates flashcards. The app is **session-based**, meaning no database is required.  

## âœ¨ Features  
âœ… Upload PDF and generate flashcards dynamically  
âœ… AI-powered question and answer extraction  
âœ… Interactive flashcards with flip mode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/detailswes/ai-sdk-preview-pdf-support.git

```

Install dependencies:  
```bash
npm install
```

Set up environment variables:  
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
2. Add your API keys:  
   ```env
